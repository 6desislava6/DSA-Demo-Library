DSA-Demo-Library
================
A library that contains basic data structures and algorithm implementations in Java for the 
purposes of the Data Structure + Algorithms course @ FMI, SU.

## Data structure comparison
The following table summarizes what we already know about the algorithmic complexity of 
the basic operations on several data structures.


| Data structure  | Get | Append | Insert | RemoveAt  | Search |
|-----------------|:---:|:------:|:------:|:---------:|:------:|
| Sequential List (Dynamic Array)  | `O(1)`  | `O(1)`<sub>A</sub> | `O(n)` | `O(n)` | `O(n)` |

* Subscript <sub>A</sub> means that the complexity is amortized.
